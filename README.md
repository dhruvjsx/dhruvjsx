<hr/>
**Gender:** JavaScript  
**Pronouns:** `Async`/`Await`

**Fun Facts:**

- **Dhruv's Pet Peeve:** Being forced to use `var` instead of `let` or `const`. It prefers modern syntax because it feels more “in the now.”
  
- **Favorite Hobby:** Creating branches that will never be merged.
  
- **Relationship Status:** It's complicated (with TypeScript).

**Favorite Pick-Up Line:** "Are you a JSON object? Because you've got all the right properties."

**Quirky Habit:** JavaScript loves throwing surprises at developers, like treating `[] == ![]` as `true`. It swears it makes sense, but it’s really just testing your patience.

**Favorite Hangout Spot:** The event loop, where it can keep an eye on everything happening in the browser, making sure no callback goes uncalled.

**Philosophy:** JavaScript lives by the motto "Don’t limit yourself." It believes in being everywhere at once—front end, back end, and beyond. It’s the ultimate multitasker, even if it sometimes bites off more than it can chew.

**JavaScript’s Wardrobe:** JavaScript’s fashion is eclectic, mixing old-school features like `prototype` inheritance with trendy new ones like arrow functions and async/await. It loves to accessorize with a variety of frameworks and libraries—React, Angular, Vue—you name it, JavaScript has tried it on.

**Favorite Friends:** JavaScript is best friends with JSON, the pair are inseparable when it comes to data exchange. It also has a close bond with HTML and CSS, as they often work together to make web pages shine.

**Quirky Anecdote:** Once, Dhruv tried to explain why `"5" + 3` is `"53"` but `5 + "3"` is also `"53"`, and why `5 - "3"` is `2`. It ended up confusing itself and everyone else in the room. The explanation concluded with, "You just have to trust me on this one."


JavaScript is that unpredictable friend who’s always full of surprises, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately indispensable. Whether you love it or hate it, you can’t ignore its influence on the world of programming!
